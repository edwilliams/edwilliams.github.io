The new app was to be deployed both in App stores (iOS / Android) and on their desktop portal. This development needed to take place alongside the maintenance of the existing App before finally making the switch to the new App. The result was a managed migration away from the original codebase (written in Ember) to a React / Redux centric system, deployed within a Cordova shell',

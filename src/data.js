  about: [
    'As a software engineer, I have many years of commercial experience in building robust and scalable websites / webapps and API\'s.',
    'Specialising in React / Redux, I favour a functional / declarative approach to writing JavaScript and always seeks to lift as much of a codebase into pure functions as possible, where it can be written into utilities / libraries and tested.',
    'As a UI expert I am equally at home styling interfaces with JavaScript as I am with CSS / SASS and have extensive experience with animations (CSS, SVG and WebGL).',
    'A keen advocate of PWA’s, I conform to development best practices whilst retaining solid commercial experience of Cordova and App store deployment.',
    'Having worked end-to-end on many large projects I am comfortable taking on all of the above alongside designing MySQL or noSQL databases, writing Bash build scripts and architecting API’s with either Node or PHP.',
    'I am experienced in communicating with stakeholders and clients alike, whether consulting for small enterprises or scoping projects for multinationals (Jaguar Land Rover, Good Energy, Nike, VUE, et al).',
    'As a Kanban enthusiast, I have brought Agile working to teams and believe in quick and direct communication with all colleagues and stakeholders.',
    'My work history (which also includes music and guitar teaching) has enabled me to effectively mentor junior developers and has given me a lifelong appreciation for what can be achieved by teamwork, as well as the ability to be effective both solo and remotely.',

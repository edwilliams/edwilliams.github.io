- write a library that computes some statistics about integers stored in a file
- the file is text in csv format, with integers typically in the range -1000 to +1000
- include instructions about how to compile and use it

the statistics to compute are:
- total number of integers
- mean value of all integers (to three decimal places)
- highest number of integers in a single line
- most common integer

- weâ€™ll check the accuracy of the output
- assess the code for readability and style
- consider how easy it is to extend the program to compute additional statistics
